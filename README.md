# spinner
decision wheel created using python. Thought it would be fun challenge to create a decision wheel per user input in python. To breakdown the project, I decided to first do a test spinner that uses the terminal as input rather than a form. The spinner is essentially a rotating pie chart with the # of slices and label of each slice determined by the user. I will be using matplotlib since that library includes a animation function. This was the easy part. 

next task is to create a GUI using the tkinter and embed the matplotlib pie chart into a frame in the tkinter GUI. Eventually I hope to use BeeWare to be able to run this on Android.
